## ðŸš€ How to Build & Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/F4P1E/BubbleSortApp.git
   cd BubbleSortApp
````

2. **Build with Maven**

   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.App"
   ```

   Or, if you packaged the jar:

   ```bash

## ðŸ§® About Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process repeats until the list is sorted.

Although not efficient for large datasets (average and worst-case time complexity of O(nÂ²)), itâ€™s useful for educational purposes and small arrays.
